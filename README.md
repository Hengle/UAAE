# Unity Assets Advanced Editor
Unity .assets and AssetBundle editor

UAAE is an advanced editor for Unity .assets and AssetBundle files. It is based on DerPopo's UABE tool, but improves its functions.
UAAE isn't so `advanced` because it is still missing a lot of features and may have some bugs, so unless your game is unity 2019.3+, please use the original [UABE](https://github.com/DerPopo/UABE) for now. But it's better than nothing at all. Feel free to contribute.
